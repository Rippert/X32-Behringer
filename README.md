# X32 / OSC utilities #
## SnapBack Test branch of Rippert fork ##

This branch is diverging from the X32-Behringer starting point
It is developing XAir mixer utilities exclusively, but not the
same ones that are included in X32-Behringer. It is not concerned
with the majority of files in the master branch.

That being the case, a new reposity is set up at:
https://github.com/Rippert/XAir-Behringer.git
